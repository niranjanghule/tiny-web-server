# tiny-web-server
A basic web server implementation using Java.

## What is this project?
I watched Robert C. Martin's episode on creating your own web server.
We can simply spin up our own web server, rather than spending time on configuring a web server whose many features are not used.
This server can be modified as per our need though its not very powerful.

## What I learnt from this project?
- [x] Socket programming
- [x] Handling threading issues
- [x] Test driven development
- [x] Basic HTTP request and response structure
- [x] Web browsers handling of HTTP request.
